##Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

SELECT * FROM companies;

## Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

UPDATE companies SET revenue=18000000 WHERE name="Subprime Loans LLC";

## Display the information in both tables using one query.

SELECT * FROM companies, year_ends;

##Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

SELECT companies.name, year_ends.date FROM companies JOIN year_ends ON companies.fiscalyear = year_ends.id;

## Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

DELETE FROM companies WHERE name="Subprime Loans LLC";

##Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output.

SELECT name, revenue, year_ends.date FROM companies LEFT JOIN year_ends ON companies.fiscalyear = year_ends.id; 
SELECT name, revenue, year_ends.date FROM companies INNER JOIN year_ends ON companies.fiscalyear = year_ends.id;
