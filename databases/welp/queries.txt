##You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT *  FROM reviews LEFT JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.business_id LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.user_id;

##There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, reviews.business_id, businesses.business_name, reviews.user_id, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews LEFT JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.business_id LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.user_id;

##How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

SELECT *  FROM reviews LEFT JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.business_id LEFT JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.user_id WHERE reviews.business_id=1;
